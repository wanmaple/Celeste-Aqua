# Aqua

## Introduction

This is a Celeste MOD which gives Madeline a new tool: Grappling Hook!

Grappling Hook is a powerful tool which enhances Madeline a lot. Despite some basic operations, we also provide a lot of features such as hooking specific entities toward Madeline or making Madeline fly toward them.

Varieties of old entities are made interactable with the grappling hook, a lot of new entities also give the Gameplay a lot of fun.

However, we’d like to make a formal map for Aqua but it’s such a heavy work. We provide an experimental map to let you know the grappling hook well.

If you want to make your own map based on Aqua, I haven’t written any document yet, maybe later or not. But you can ask me if you have any questions about the MOD.

## State

The MOD is still in development.
