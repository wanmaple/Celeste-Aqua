# Aqua

## Introduction

This is a Celeste MOD which gives Madeline a new tool: Grappling Hook!

Grappling Hook is a powerful tool which enhances Madeline a lot. You could swing almost everywhere. Despite some basic operations, we also provide a lot of features such as hooking specific entities toward Madeline or making Madeline fly toward them.

Varieties of old entities are made interactable with the grappling hook, a lot of new entities also give the Gameplay a lot of fun.

## MOD Interop

AQUA provides some functions to help you make your custom entities interactable with the grappling hook. You can check it [here](https://github.com/wanmaple/Celeste-Aqua/wiki/Custom-with-Aqua).

AQUA will also add compatibilities to some popular MODs, but it’s such a heavy work. I’ll handle them step by step.

## TODOs

- Interaction with holdables.
- Other entities interactable with grappling hook.
- Lots of compatibilities for other MODs.
